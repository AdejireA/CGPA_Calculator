# CGPA Calculator

## Description

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the Grade Point Average (GPA) for a student based on their grades and course units. The user inputs their name, year, the number of courses they have taken for the semester, and for each course, the grade and course unit. The program then calculates and displays the GPA.

## Features

- User input for student name and year.
- User input for the number of courses taken.
- For each course, user inputs the grade and course unit.
- Grades are converted to points based on a predefined scale.
- Total Load Units (TLU) and Total Credit Points (TCP) are calculated.
- GPA is calculated and displayed.

## Grade to Point Conversion

- A: 5 points
- B: 4 points
- C: 3 points
- D: 2 points
- E: 1 point
- F: 0 points
